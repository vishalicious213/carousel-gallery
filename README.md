# Carousel / Gallery

Testing a responsive carousel / gallery switch
- Should default to carousel
- At greater widths, switch from carousel to gallery
- Should be able to render two datasets
    - Maintain the dataset regardless of whether its using carousel or gallery

For example, we have two sets of data, puppies and kittens. User can choose which set to view. Render will display the proper set regardless of whether it's viewed in the carousel or the gallery.

- Displaying the carousel or gallery should be controlled via CSS
- Choosing which dataset to display should be controlled via JS
    - Use buttons to switch from one set to the other
